# Shell
I touch this codebase whenever I can but it's not often. I have a backlog full of stuff and 1000 bugs and only like 5 features. I'm doing it. Slowly.

This should help me get an idea of how a shell works under the hood. The plan is to tailor it to my needs, make it super lightweight and maybe push it into a Raspberry Pi or something.
